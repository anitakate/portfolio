<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am Catherine and I come from a very humble background.I studied at St.Clare of Assisi secondary school and have lately joined the Moringa school to learn about coding .The reason as to why i've decide to learn programming after my high school is because programming forces one to collaborate with others and solve problems in an effectively and productively way and it also gives one sence of energy to really pursue some goals in life.</p>
